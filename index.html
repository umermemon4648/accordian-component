        <div class="answer">
            <p>Undeclared variables are those that do not exist in a program and are not declared. If the program tries to read the value of an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is encountered.</p>
                <p>Undefined variables are those that are declared in the program but have not been given any value. If the program tries to read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned.</p>

            <h4>What is the working of timers in JavaScript?</h4>
            <i class="icons fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Timers are used to execute a piece of code at a set time or repeat the code in a given interval. This is done by using the functions setTimeout, setInterval, and clearInterval.</p>
            <p>The setTimeout(function, delay) function is used to start a timer that calls a particular function after the mentioned delay. The setInterval(function, delay) function repeatedly executes the given function in the mentioned delay and only halts when canceled. The clearInterval(id) function instructs the timer to stop.</p>
            <p>
                Timers are operated within a single thread, and thus events might queue up, waiting to be executed.</p>
